	<p>This user guide is intended to show you how to setup a file for automatic cutting on the DPCâ€™s Roland SolJet wide-format printer. This demo uses Adobe Illustrator CS3, but the same process can be done in older versions of Illustrator, Adobe InDesign, QuarkXPress, or any application where you can define custom spot color swatches.</p>

	<a alt="doc1.html">Combine PDFs (Short)</a>
	<p>Rather than having to fill out several job tickets, for PDFs that have the same printing specifications (i.e. sheet size, color/B&amp;W, simplex/duplex, orientation, scaling), it is more efficient to combine all PDFs into one.</p>
