                  <p>Job tickets are associated with specific files. If you have
                     multiple files with the same specifications (i.e. print
                     device, sheet size, duplex/simplex, orientation), we
                     recommend combining them into one PDF file. This
                     will speed up processing and reduce the amount of
                     work for you.
