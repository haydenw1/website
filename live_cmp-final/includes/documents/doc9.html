      <h1 xmlns="">Preserving Image Quality in Page Layout</h1>
      <h2 xmlns=""></h2>
      
      
      <h2 xmlns="">Alternative Resources</h2>
      
      <p xmlns="">This document is intended to help you preserve image quality 
         as you work with your files in page layout applications. This 
         document only covers image quality in its most basic form.
      </p>
      
      <p xmlns="">For a more in-depth understanding of this topic, we recommend 
         the following School of Print Media classes: Print Production 
         Workflow and Digital Foundations. If you have questions, 
         please consult your instructor or a DPC Customer Service Representative (CSR).
      </p>
      
      
      <h2 xmlns="">Linked Images</h2>
      
      <p xmlns="">In most layout applications (e.g. InDesign, QuarkXPress), the 
         most important aspect to remember while working with images 
         is that all images must be linked back to their original files. 
         Placing or importing 
         <span style="font-style:italic">(Figure 1)</span> an image into these layouts only 
         creates a link back to the original image file. If files become 
         unlinked, a low-resolution (72 ppi) image is used in its place.
      </p>
      
      <p xmlns="">Therefore, it is always important for the layout application to 
         maintain the path back to the original image. Ignoring warnings 
         about unlinked files will only lead to low resolution and poor 
         output 
         <span style="font-style:italic">(Figure 2)</span>. If PDF files are created properly, they will 
         include all necessary elements and images in a single file.

      <h2 xmlns="">Embedded Images</h2>
      
      <p xmlns="">Embedding images is the alternative option to linking the images 
         to the document. By copying and pasting an image from another 
         program in your layout document, the image will be embedded in 
         the document. In contrast, by linking the image to its original file, 
         you are creating a reference back to the original image.
      </p>
      
      <p xmlns="">Although pasting the image will not degrade the image quality, 
         it does create some functional issues. First, it increases the file 
         size of your layout document. Second, since there is no link back 
         to the original; if the original is modified, the image will have 
         to be re-pasted. Also, if your layout document should become 
         corrupt, deleted or lost, the embedded images will also be 
         corrupt, deleted or lost. In a more streamlined workflow, linked 
         images will automatically update themselves in the layout 
         document if they have been modified.
      </p>
      
      <p xmlns="">Many users assume that embedding images into their layout 
         document means that there will be fewer files to manage. 
         However, both Adobe and Quark have created easy solutions for 
         gathering the layout assets (e.g. anything placed or imported 
         into the document) in one common place. In Adobe InDesign, 
         this is referred to as “packaging” a file 
         <span style="font-style:italic">(Figure 3)</span>. In QuarkXPress, 
         this is referred to as “collecting for output”.

      <h2 xmlns="">Low-Resolution Images</h2>
      
      <p xmlns="">A generally accepted resolution when printing images is 300 ppi. 
         Therefore, it is important to preserve this resolution throughout 
         page composition and processing. Low-resolution images, such 
         as those taken from a website (72 ppi), will typically be visibly 
         pixilated when printed 
         <span style="font-style:italic">(Figure 4)</span>. Resampling a low-resolution 
         image to a higher resolution using Photoshop may soften the 
         image and create an undesirable file. In Photoshop, by disabling 
         “Resample Image”, the user can see the actual amount of original 
         pixel data available for use 
         <span style="font-style:italic">(Figure 5)</span>.
         
      </p>

      <img xmlns="" src="images/9_figure5.jpg"></img>
      <span xmlns="" class="caption">Figure 5: Image resize options in Adobe Photoshop (Image &gt; Image Size)</span>
      
      
      <p xmlns="">Unfortunately, in this case, more is better. The more pixel data 
         available, the more adjustment you have up or down. For 
         example, a typical 8-megapixel camera produces images that are 
         about 3266 by 2450 pixels. Divide each dimension by 300 to find 
         the largest quality image you can print. In this case, 3266 / 300 = 
         10.89" and 2450 / 300 = 8.17 inches. Thus, any print of this image 
         that is larger than 10.89" by 8.17" will be degraded in quality. 
         However, images printed at a smaller size will not be.
      </p>
      
      <p xmlns="">Put simply, images captured at print resolution will be 
         appropriate for print or web (they will need to be resampled for 
         web due to file size). However, images captured or saved for web 
         content will not be appropriate for quality prints.
      </p>
      
      
      <h2 xmlns="">High-Resolution Images</h2>
      
      <p xmlns="">While some print processes, such as wide-format inkjet, may see 
         quality advantages from a resolution higher than 300 ppi, this 
         is not true for all types of output (digital or conventional). For 
         more complex files, such as multiple-page PDFs, including many 
         images at a resolution higher than 300 ppi will increase file size 
         and processing time. The overall difference in quality may not be 
         worth this extended processing time.
      </p>
      
      <p xmlns="">If you are working in a page-layout application, such as InDesign 
         or QuarkXPress, there are options to resample the images as they 
         are exported into a PDF file 
         <span style="font-style:italic">(Figure 6)</span>. For more information on 
         this, please reference the “Understanding Options for Saving to PDF” guide.

      <h2 xmlns="">Resizing Images</h2>
      
      <p xmlns="">Image resizing, whether it be up or down, should preferably 
         be done in an image processing application (e.g. Photoshop). 
         Although page-layout applications are physically capable of 
         resizing images, an application like Photoshop is a more capable 
         application to manipulate raster images.
      </p>
      
      <p xmlns="">In a page-layout application, even if an image is manually 
         downsized, the excess pixel data still exists in the original linked 
         file. Therefore, this will reflect in the file size of the document 
         (if embedded), PDF (if not resampled), or the packaged folder. 
         The image transformations will have to be processed at the RIP, 
         which will lead to longer production times.
         
      </p>
      
      <p xmlns="">In a performed test, a document containing a TIFF image 
         (originally, 300 ppi at 18" by 13.5") that was sized down to 3" by 
         2.24" in InDesign (but not resampled in Photoshop) yielded a 
         packaged “Links” folder size of 89.5 MB. However, a document 
         with the same image downsampled in Photoshop before being 
         placed into InDesign yielded a “Links” folder size of 2.9 MB.
