      <h2 xmlns="">Alternative Resources</h2>
      
      <p xmlns="">This document is intended to help you prepare your files to print in the most logical
         and economical manner. This document only covers imposition (the layout of documents
         for print) in its most basic form. It primarily focuses on digital printing imposition.
      </p>
      
      <p xmlns="">For a more in-depth understanding of this topic, we recommend the following School
         of Print Media class: Print Production Workflow. If you have questions, please consult
         your instructor or a DPC Customer Service Representative.
      </p>
      
      
      
      <h2 xmlns="">Important Facts</h2>
      
      <p xmlns="">In the graphic arts industry, laying out multiple pages for print is called imposition.
         Generally speaking, imposition is the arrangement of documents on a printed sheet.
         Imposition is often used to make the most economical use of the sheet or for generating
         a proper page sequence (depending on binding type). Imposition should always be considered
         during file creation because it is highly influenced by sheet size, print device,
         and finishing methods.
      </p>
      
      
      
      <h2 xmlns="">'Multi-Up' Form Imposition</h2>
      
      
      <p xmlns="">A multiple-up form refers to placing more than one copy of the same design on a page.
         In the DPC, a commonly imposed form is a sheet of business cards. See 
         <span style="font-style:italic">Figure 1</span> for an example.
      </p>
      
      <img xmlns="" src="images/10_figure1.jpg"></img>
      <span xmlns="" class="caption">Figure 1: Multiple Business card files imposed onto a letter size sheet</span>
      
      <p xmlns="">If you do not have a professional multi-up imposition application (i.e. Kodak Preps
         Ganging) page layout applications (i.e. InDesign, Quark XPress) can be used to manually
         impose documents. For documents with multiple pages and more complex impositions,
         this process may become tedious. However, for “multi-up” (e.g. multiple copies on
         one sheet) impositions, they will suffice. In this instructional section, most examples
         will be displayed using Adobe InDesign.

            <p>Create a new document in any page layout application or Adobe Illustrator. The document
               size should be the size of your final output sheet (i.e. 8.5" by 11" US Letter, 11"
               by 17" US Tabloid, 12" by 18"). This final sheet should be large enough to fit multiple
               copies of the original file with space in between.

               your documents more consistently. The application may offer a tool for this (i.e.
               InDesign’s Align and Distribute Objects palette).

            <p>Align items accurately. Use guides or grids in a high-quality display view to impose
               and align your items. Remember, aligning your items is critical because this will
               affect how well your items are trimmed to final size. Illustrator offers a tool to
               help this called Align and Distribute Objects

      <p xmlns="">Using a professional imposition application, such as Kodak Preps Ganging, is much
         more accurate and reliable. However, these types of applications are not always intuitive
         for new users.
      </p>
      
      <p xmlns="">Please ask any available CSR for a demonstration on how to impose your “multi-up”
         imposition using Kodak Preps Ganging. Also, please note that this application is not
         available on all computers. Please consult with a CSR for help on this topic.

      <h2 xmlns="">Imposition for Multi-Page Documents</h2>
      
      <p xmlns="">Before imposing your multi-page document, you need to determine the page count, binding
         style, bleed, and printer margin.
      </p>
      
      
      
      <p xmlns="">
         “2-Up, 4-Up, 8-Up”:These phrases refer to the number of alike images/documents on one side of a printed
         sheet. See Figure 2 (previous section) for an example of an 8-Up imposition.
         
      </p>
      
      <p xmlns="">
         Saddle-Stitch:This is a binding method of stapling sheets together at the spine (center, bound part
         of the book). Depending on the amount of bound sheets, the imposition may need to
         factor in “creep”. (See definiton of “creep” )
         
      </p>
      
      <p xmlns="">
         Perfect-Bound:This is a binding method where printed sheets have been ground at the spine and are
         adhered to the book’s spine by glue. Depending on the design, the imposition may need
         to include bleeds for items that crossover a reader spread. 
         
      </p>
      
      <p xmlns="">
         Margins:This refers to the white space between the edge of the printed area and the edge of
         the media or copy on the page.
         
      </p>
      
      <p xmlns="">
         Gap:This setting applies to imposition styles that do not require the left and right pages
         to have touching spines, such as a wire or coil binding. The gap setting determines
         the amount of space between printed items on a sheet.
         
      </p>
      
      <p xmlns="">
         Bleed:This refers to printing that goes beyond the edge of the sheet after trimming. The
         bleed area is the extended image of the printed document that gives the DPC printer
         that small margin of error for shift between sheets and finishing inconsistencies.
         By US standards, bleeds are generally 1/8 of an inch (0.125") from where the cut is
         to be made.
         
      </p>
      
      <p xmlns="">
         Creep:Depending on the binding method, the inside pages of a set of folded pages may extend
         slightly beyond the outside pages. Using the “creep” setting can compensate for this
         by making the inner margin of the inside pages smaller.
         
      </p>
      
      <p xmlns="">
         Crossover:This term refers to a design element (graphic, image or text) that physically crosses
         over a reader spread. The imposition application will make a “crossover bleed” according
         to the designer’s numerical input.

         for more advanced impositions for conventional printing applications, there are dedicated
         software applications for creating impositions, such as Kodak Preps.
      </p>
      
      <p xmlns="">Using a professional imposition application is much more accurate and reliable, although
         these programs come with a steeper learning curve.
      </p>
      
      <p xmlns="">Please ask any available CSR for information and demonstration on how to impose your
         document using any applications.
