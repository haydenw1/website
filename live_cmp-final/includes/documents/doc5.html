         Our custom XMP File Info Panel, DPC Job Ticket, can be found on all CIAS computers
         within all Adobe Creative Suite applications and Adobe Acrobat Professional. This
         custom XMP Info Panel allows you to attach your job ticket information directly to
         your file. When uploading this file to SPM-Portal DPC Dropbox volume, the job ticket
         information fields will automatically synchronize to the File Info Panel information.
