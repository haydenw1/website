      <h2 xmlns="">Alternative Resources</h2>
      
      <p xmlns="">This document is intended to help you create PDFs for your desired output intent
         (e.g. image quality, color, printer marks). This document only covers PDF creation
         in its most basic form.

         Service Representative (CSR).

      <h2 xmlns="">Important Facts</h2>
      
      <p xmlns="">In the graphic arts industry, the use of a PDF workflow has grown rapidly in the past
         decade. However, problems may occur when printing PDFs that have been improperly
         created. Many of these issues can be avoided if PDF creation options are selected
         appropriately for the intended method of printing.
      </p>
      
      
      <h2 xmlns="">Creating a 'Clean' File</h2>
      
      <p xmlns="">Raster image processors (RIPs) must “flatten” and “rasterize” all graphics on a page
         before printing. The process of reducing layers, overlapping object transparency,
         text, and images into a single image can be extremely complex.
      </p>
      
      <p xmlns="">To avoid potential problems at the RIP, the following operations are recommended
         before creating your PDF:
      </p>
      
      <ol xmlns="">
         
         <li>
            
            <p>
               <span style="font-style:italic">Flatten you file:</span> If your original image contains multiple layers,
               it will increase the chances that the printer may have a problems with your
               file. Reducing your file to a single layer will help to prevent this and
               reduce processing time. However, be sure to save the original layered file
               elsewhere.
            </p>
            
         </li>
         
         <li>
            
            <p>
               <span style="font-style:italic">Remove hidden elements:</span> Just like layers, certain RIPs cannot
               handle hidden layers or objects, removing all of the elements you have
               hidden in your file can help prevent potential problems.
            </p>
            
         </li>
         
         <li>
            
            <p>
               <span style="font-style:italic">Flatten transparency:</span> Depending on how the transparencies were
               created and the type of PDF output, these objects may print in such a way
               (e.g. color) that is not desired by the designer.
            </p>
            
         </li>
         
         <li>
            
            <p>
               <span style="font-style:italic">Rasterize:</span> If your file is a complicated vector image, with
               transparency, a simple solution to reduce the number of problems that you
               might encounter with your file is to take the image into Photoshop and
               rasterize the image.
            </p>

      </ol>
      
      
      <h2 xmlns="">Locating the Tool</h2>
      
      <p xmlns="">Once you have created a clean file, the option to save your file as a PDF is located
         in a different place in the various programs.
      </p>
      
      <p xmlns="">InDesign: File &gt; Export &gt; Adobe PDF</p>
      
      <p xmlns="">Illustrator: File &gt; Save as &gt; Adobe PDF</p>

      <h2 xmlns="">Choosing PDF Options</h2>
      
      <p xmlns="">
         <span style="font-style:italic">Adobe PDF Presets:</span> Choosing a PDF preset will apply a template of basic
         settings 
         <span style="font-style:italic">(Figure 1)</span>. For sending a file to the DPC, you want to select
         Press Quality or High Quality Print, as it will best preserve your original image.
         Once you change any setting, the preset name will appear with the title “modified”
         next to it.
      </p>
      
      <p xmlns="">If you find yourself using the same settings repeatedly, you should save these
         settings to a custom preset. To do this, click “Save Preset…” at the bottom left of
         the dialogue box. 
         <span style="font-style:italic">(Figure 2)</span>

         <span style="font-style:italic">General</span>
         
         <span style="font-style:italic">(Figure 1):</span> For print, in Photoshop and Illustrator, it is
         recommended that you disable “Preserve Editing Capabilities” if it exists as an
         option. Be sure to save the original separately in order to make any edits if
         necessary
      </p>
      
      <p xmlns="">
         <span style="font-style:italic">Standards</span>
         
         <span style="font-style:italic">(Figure 1):</span> Under the Standards setting, there are options
         for various PDF/X standards. These ISO standards are for PDFs that are intended for
         print. For more information regarding which PDF/X to use for your document, refer
         to
         the ISO documentation on each standard.
      </p>
      
      <p xmlns="">
         <span style="font-style:italic">Compatibility</span>
         
         <span style="font-style:italic">(Figure 1):</span> The setting for Compatibility refers to the
         version of Adobe Acrobat that is required to open the PDF file you are creating.
         When you choose a preset, this will automatically be set. When printing in the DPC,
         we recommend the PDF 1.3 setting, unless you adhere to a standard that required a
         newer version.
      </p>
      
      <p xmlns="">
         <span style="font-style:italic">Compression</span>
         
         <span style="font-style:italic">(Figure 3):</span> This menu controls how far your image is
         downsampled. Your choice will depend on the resolution desired. A generally accepted
         resolution when printing images is 300 ppi. Depending on your image requirements,
         you may also want to change the setting for compression and image quality.

      <p xmlns="">If you plan to have your file cut down, you should include crop marks and bleeds
         (if necessary for your design). Select those marks you wish to add under the
         
         <span style="font-style:italic">Marks and Bleeds</span> panel 
         <span style="font-style:italic">(Figure 4)</span>. For
         more information on bleeds, refer to the User Resource entitled “Creating and
         Exporting Bleeds Using Adobe InDesign”.

      <p xmlns="">Under this set of options, you will find options for color management and PDF/X.
         Depending on your output requirements, you have the option to convert all raster
         and vector elements to a certain color space or leave them as they are. Under
         the color options, we recommend converting to US Web Coated (SWOP) v2 for output
         in the DPC.
