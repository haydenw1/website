      <p xmlns="">For DPC job submission, rather than having to fill out several job tickets, for PDFs
         that have the same printing specifications (i.e. sheet size, color/B&amp;W, simplex/duplex,
         orientation, scaling), it can be more efficient to combine all PDFs into one PDF.
         This will also speed up processing time in the DPC.

      <p xmlns="">This user guide is intended to instruct you on how to combine multiple PDFs into one
         PDF file. Follow these simple instructions using Adobe Acrobat 8.
