      <h2 xmlns=""></h2>
      
      
      <h2 xmlns="">Alternative Resources</h2>
      
      <p xmlns="">This document is intended to help you prepare your files submitting a saddle-stitch
         booklet to the DPC. This only covers using Adobe InDesign’s Print Booklet plug-in
         in
         its most basic functionality. Your file may require more advanced settings for
         proper output.
      </p>
      
      <p xmlns="">For a more in-depth understanding of this topic, we recommend the following School
         of
         Print Media classes: Digital Foundations and Print Production Workflow. If you have
         questions, please consult your instructor or a DPC Customer Service Representative
         (CSR).
      </p>
      
      
      <h2 xmlns="">Terms to Know</h2>
      
      <p xmlns="">
         Saddle-Stitch: This is a binding method of stapling sheets together at
         the spine (center, bound part of the book). Depending on the amount of bound
         sheets, the imposition may need to factor in “creep”. (See definiton of
         “creep”)
         
      </p>
      
      <p xmlns="">
         Duplex: Printing on both sides of a sheet of paper.
         
      </p>
      
      <p xmlns="">
         Bleed: This refers to printing that goes beyond the edge of the sheet
         after trimming. The bleed area is the extended image of the printed document
         that gives the printer that small margin of error for shift between sheets and
         finishing inconsistencies. By US standards, bleeds are generally 1/8 of an inch
         (0.125”) from where the cut is to be made.
         
      </p>
      
      <p xmlns="">
         Creep: Depending on the binding method, the inside pages of a set of
         folded pages may extend slightly beyond the outside pages. Using the “creep”
         setting can compensate for this by making the inner margin of the inside pages
         smaller. This is commonly seen in saddle-stitch booklets with a large number of
         pages (usually over 16 pages).
         
      </p>
      
      
      <h2 xmlns="">How to Choose the Correct Document Settings</h2>
      
      
      <p xmlns="">Depending on the design of your book, you may want certain elements (e.g. images,
         graphics) to print to the trim of the document. This requires a special setting
         known as bleed margins. The setting can be found in the initial document set-up
         dialogue box or modified once the document has been created 
         <span style="font-weight:bold">(Edit &gt;
            Document Setup)
         </span>. Detailed instructions for creating bleeds can be
         found in the DPC User Resource entitled “Creating and Exporting Bleeds Using
         Adobe InDesign”.
      </p>
      
      
      
      <p xmlns="">The document margins of any document are typically used to provide numerical
         guides to the designer’s layout. However, document margins or rules can also
         serve as a warning for the designer. For saddle-stitch booklets, an inside
         document margin is not necessary because there is no physical interruption
         between spreads. The pages sit directly next to each other.
      </p>
      
      <p xmlns="">However, wire-bound books require an inside document margin of at least 0.25".
         The hole punches for the wire end at about 0.25" into the gutter (space between
         the binding edge and the copy) of the spreads. For tape bound or perfect-bound
         books (for digital print production), there are no hole-punches that will
         interrupt the design; however, because of this fact these types of books will
         not lay flat, meaning that a portion of the inner margin will not be readable.
         Designers should avoid putting type or other important elements within this
         gutter.
      </p>
      
      
      
      <h2 xmlns="">How to Use Print Booklet</h2>
      
      <p xmlns="">InDesign Print Booklet is a plug-in that is included with the purchase of Adobe
         InDesign CS3. In the previous version, this plug-in was called InBooklet SE. For a
         DPC customer, this plug-in serves as a helpful tool for creating impositions of
         booklets that will be saddle-stitched after printing. Follow these simple
         instructions to use this plug-in.
      </p>

         <li>
            
            <p>Prepare the book for output (e.g. finish design, preflight, save). At this
               stage packaging your InDesign document is recommended (File &gt; Package).
               Packaging your file will simply put of your document assets (i.e. InDesign
               file, links, fonts) into one folder. To create a reader-spread PDF of your
               document, you can export to PDF as well (File &gt; Export).

            <p>
               Printer: Choose presets for the print job. The specifications
               for these options can be found under Print Settings. Either Adobe PDF
               8.0 or Postscript File should be selected.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               Booklet Type: Choose the type of booklet desired. For a
               saddle-stitch book, the 2-up Saddle Stitch option should be chosen. For
               a perfect bound book, the 2-up Perfect Bound option should be chosen
               (not applicable for the DPC).
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               Space Between Pages: This option will show for all booklet
               types except 2-up Saddle Stitch. Inserting a value here will create a
               space of that size between each pair of pages.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               Bleed Between Pages: This option is also known as crossover
               bleed and is only available for the 2-up Perfect Bound booklet type. It
               specifies the amount of space used for bleeds in the spread gutter. It
               will only accept values between 0 and one half of the Space Between
               Pages value.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               Creep: Depending on the binding method, the pages closer to
               the center of the booklet may extend slightly beyond the outside pages.
               Using the “creep” setting can compensate for this by making the inner
               margin of the those pages smaller.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               Signature Size: This option is only available for the 2-up
               Perfect Bound option. Signatures are the individual booklets that make
               up a perfect bound book. This option allows the user to select the
               number of pages in a signature.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               Margins: This option is available for all booklet types. It
               provides an option for the user to add predefined white space or a
               margin between the end of the printed area and edge of the
               sheet.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               Blank Printer Spreads: Selecting this option verifies that any
               blank pages in the document are counted as actual pages in the
               imposition. If not enabled, they will be excluded from the
               imposition.

            <p>Setup
               <span style="font-style:italic">(Figure 4):</span> This panel contains
               options for paper size and orientation as well image scaling and
               positioning. Choosing “Custom” under Paper Size will define the dimensions
               based on the original InDesign document and the booklet type chosen.
               Otherwise, the dimensions should be chosen based on the sheet size that will
               be used for printing (e.g. US Letter, US Tabloid). For duplex (double-sided)
               printing, it is important that the Page Position is selected as
               “Centered”.
