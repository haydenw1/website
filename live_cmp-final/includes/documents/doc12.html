         This user guide is intended to show you how to setup a file
         for automatic cutting on the DPC’s Roland SolJet wide-format printer. This demo uses
         Adobe Illustrator CS3, but the same process can be done in older versions of Illustrator,
         Adobe InDesign, QuarkXPress, or any application where you can define custom spot color
         swatches.

            <p>
               Note: You can set the color mode to whatever you like, but it is best to use a bright
               color that shows up well in your file, so you can easily see your path. For example,
               100% red or magenta.

      <h2 xmlns="">Defining the CutContour Area</h2>
      
      <p xmlns="">
         As with all mechanical equipment, the cut controls are not perfect and there may be
         a slight alignment shift. If you are planning to have full bleed stickers, incorporate
         a bleed of at least 0.125”. For more information on bleed, refer to 
         <span style="font-style:italic">Creating and Exporting Bleeds Using Adobe InDesign.</span>
         
      </p>
      
      <ol xmlns="">
         
         <li>
            
            <p>
               Select the Pen tool and set the “fill” to none and the “stroke” to your CutContour
               swatch. The stroke should be set to 1pt.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               Tip: It is good practice to keep your CutContour shapes isolated to one layer, so
               create a new layer above all of your artwork or the image you are planning to cut

            <p>
               Note: While the cut controls can some difficult angles, do try to keep the number
               of points to an efficient number.

         <li>
            
            <p>Once you have completed your cutting path, confirm that the path is closed, so that
               the cut is complete and the cut portion will come off without tearing.
