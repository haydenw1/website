         This document is intended to help you organize and automate your files during the
         creative stage. This document only covers batch processing in its most basic form
         (i.e. batch renaming, applying Photoshop Actions).

         For a more in-depth understanding of this topic, we recommend the following School
         of Print Media class: Digital Asset Management. If you have questions, please consult
         your instructor or a DPC Customer Service Representative (CSR).

         When indexing a large number of images, it may be beneficial to create a file naming
         convention for better organization. This first tutorial woll walk you through the
         steps required to rename multiple foles in one step using Adobe Bridge CS3.
         
      </p>
      
      <p xmlns="">
         Actions created in Photoshop can be performed on multiple images through Adobe Bridge.
         This includes resizing images
         to a standard size, performing color conversion, running filters on several images
         at once, and you can create other actions using Photoshop. The only pre-requisite
         is that you have to first create these actions in Photoshop before Bridge can perform
         them. Once this has been done, you can follow the second set of instructions to batch
         apply the action using Adobe Bridge CS3.

               d. The

               in the current Bridge folder are processed.

               <span style="font-style:italic">Override Action “Open” Commands</span> option, the
               action must contain an open command. Otherwise, the Batch command will not open the
               files you have selected for batch processing. Selecting this option does not disregard
               everything in an open command—only the choice of files to open. 
               
            </p>
            
            <p> Deselect this option if the action was intended to operate on an open file, or if

            <p>
               c. The 
               <span style="font-style:italic">Suppress Color Profile Warnings</span> option will turn off display of color management policy messages.
               
            </p>

               d. The 
               <span style="font-style:italic">Suppress File Open Options Dialogs</span> option hides file open dialog boxes. This is useful when batching actions on camera
               raw image files. The default or previously specified settings will be used.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               e. The 
               <span style="font-style:italic">Destination</span> section configures the filenaming convention for processed files.
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p>i. The 
               <span style="font-style:italic">None</span> option leaves the files open without saving changes (unless the action includes a
               Save command).
            </p>
            
            <p>ii. The 
               <span style="font-style:italic">Save And Close</span> option saves the foles in their current location, overwriting the original files.
            </p>
            
            <p>iii. The 
               <span style="font-style:italic">Folder</span> option saves the processed files to another location. Click Choose to specify the
               destination folder.
            </p>
            
            <p>
               f. To use the 
               <span style="font-style:italic">Override Action “Save As” Commands</span> option,
               the action must contain a Save As command. Otherwise,
               the Batch command woll not save the processed foles. Selecting this option does not
               skip everything in the 
               <span style="font-style:italic">Save As</span> command—only the specified filename and folder.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>If you do not select this option and your action includes a 
               <span style="font-style:italic">Save As</span> command, your files will be saved into the folder specified by the 
               <span style="font-style:italic">Save As</span> command in the action, instead
               of the folder specified in the 
               <span style="font-style:italic">Batch</span> command. In addition,
               if you do not select this option and the 
               <span style="font-style:italic">Save As</span> command
               in the action specifies a filename, the 
               <span style="font-style:italic">Batch</span> command overwrites the same file (the file specified in the action) each time it
               processes an image.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               g. The 
               <span style="font-style:italic">Filenaming</span> option will specify filenaming conventions if writing files to a new folder.

               h. The Compatibility option will create filenames compatible with particular operating
               systems.

               i. The 
               <span style="font-style:italic">Error</span> drop-down menu specifies how to handle processing errors:
            </p>
            
            <p>i. 
               <span style="font-style:italic">Stop For Errors</span> suspends the process until you confirm the error message.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>ii. 
               <span style="font-style:italic">Log Errors to File</span> records each error in a file without stopping the process. If errors are logged to
               a file, a message appears after processing. To review the error file, open with a
               text editor after the Batch command has run.
