      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        My Silver Wings chapter wanted a new t-shirt to be printed and sold. I
        created a design that improved on previous designs while showing our
        organization's patriotic spirit.
      </p>


      <h1>Approach</h1>

      <h2>Design</h2>
      <p>
        My design features the Silver Wings motto in a strong typeface with distressed
        letters, and an American flag masked to create the last word: "serve". I made two
        color schemes (below): one design with white type on a dark gray shirt, and one
        with blue type on a light gray shirt.
      </p>

      <div class="swipeSlider" id="3"></div>

      <h2>Text Layout and Effects</h2>

      <p>The text and other design elements in the t-shirt design were laid out in InDesignâ€”once I finalized the layout I used Photoshop to add the distressed effect to the design.</p>


      <h1>Summary</h1>
      <p>
        This t-shirt design fits the strong volunteer efforts and selflessness of
        Silver Wings members by using a thick typeface with distressed letters.
        <span class="bold">The flag added color to the design, but it makes the word
        "serve" harder to read</span> (to a point that it should have been removed or altered).
      </p>

        <p class="description description--image description--image--tall">Printed t-shirt width color issues (see below)</p>
      </div>

      <h1>Possible Improvements</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>There were some problems with the flag and t-shirt colors in the
        final print (shown above). Next time I will need to request a proof from
        the printing company before finalizing the print job.</li>
        <li>The design to be printed was put to a vote, and the blue version was selected. I think the white version of the design would end up looking better on a grey t-shirt.</li>
      </ul>
