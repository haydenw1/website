          <h2 class="masthead sub1">Activities</h2>

          <h3 class="masthead sub2">SILVER WINGS</h3>

          <p>Silver Wings is a national co-ed professional organization. It is made up of civilians dedicated to developing our members personally and professionally, volunteering in our communities, and educating others about national defense.</p>

          <p>Silver Wings is associated with the U.S. Air Force and several other military organizations. Some of our members are Air Force Reserve Officers' Training Corps (AFROTC) cadets acting in a civilian capacity; however, I am not a cadet (just an interested civilian).</p>

          <p class="bold">My time in Silver Wings has taught me the importance of communication and the difficulties that come with undertaking new projects and initiatives, <span class="italic">particularly across long distances</span>. While in Silver Wings I have also been given opportunities to speak to groups ranging from 20 to 200 people.</p>

          <h3 class="masthead sub2">RIT CLUB RUGBY</h3>

          <p>I started playing club Rugby at RIT in the spring of 2015. I had never played the game before, but my friend was coming out for the team and I decided that I should try something new; now I love the challenge of learning and competing in this sport. <span class="bold italic">I play flanker!</span></p>

          <h2 class="masthead sub1">Hobbies</h2>

          <h3 class="masthead sub2">Programming</h3>

          <p>Most of my programming practice and knowledge is with JavaScript, but I have practiced other languages. I am always interested in making something new with code; I have a notebook where I keep my ideas that I slowly work on when I have time.</p>

          <h3 class="masthead sub2">Weightlifting and Exercise</h3>

          <p>I try to stay active and fit, and weightlifting is one of my hobbies. Working out or playing a sport keeps me focused and pushing towards a goal.</p>

          <p>I grew up in a small rural town called Lodi, located in upstate New York. It is a beautiful area in the middle of the finger lakes, and my family has a house near Seneca Lake. I still love going back home to see my family and our dog.</p>
