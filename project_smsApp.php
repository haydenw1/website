      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p>I worked on this project over a ten week period with another student; we were advised by two of our professors from our program. Our main goal was to create an interactive application, using new Adobe software, that showcased the School of Media Sciences (SMS) at RIT to potential students, current students, and alumni.</p>

      <h1>App Mockups</h1>
      <p>Shown below are examples of the most recent versions of the app’s home screen and article design on different devices.</p>
      <div class="swipeSlider swipeSlider--no-caption" id="0">
      </div>

      <h1>Approach</h1>
      <h2 id="spareOrphan">Adobe Experience Manager&mdash;Mobile</h2>
      <p>The Media Arts and Technology program at the Rochester Institute of Technology has connections with Adobe's digital publishing team; because of this connection, we were offered an opportunity to develop an application to serve as a student study using Adobe's new digital publishing beta: Adobe Experience Manager&mdash;Mobile.</p>
      <p>This software moves away from monthly digital publication releases towards
        fluid, constantly updating content with a higher level of user interaction.</p>

      <h2>Interactive Articles</h2>
      <p>As the "technical lead" of this project I was responsible for creating
        and testing interactive content, and handling app settings, layout, and distribution.</p>

        <p>Interactive articles for the app were created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
        to ensure proper device resizing and a high level of user interaction. Adobe's
        software allowed me to directly publish these html articles to our application.</p>

      <h3>Co-op Map</h3>
      <p>The co-op map is an interactive article I made that uses the Google Maps API and JavaScript to display the locations of student’s co-op companies. View the full project write up by clicking the link below.</p>

      <a href="project_map.php">
        <div class="project-card project-card--in-text-link">
          <div class="div--card-height-limiter">
            <img class="image image_project" src="assets/projects/map/mapPanZoom.jpg"/>
          </div>
          <p class="title title_project">Co-op Map</p>
          <p class="date date_project">July 2015</p>
        </div>
      </a>

      <!--<div class="div--button-shadow-padding">
          <a href="project_map.php">
            <p class="button button--in-text button--in-text--project button--in-text--right">View my co-op map project</p>
          </a>
        </div>-->

      <!--<p>
        <span class="bold">Pictured below are screenshots from an interactive article
        I developed for our app.</span> In this article users touch sections of a "donut"
        graph to see what percentage of our students get a co-op in that industry, and read
        other app articles related to that industry.
      </p>-->

      <!--<div class="swipeSlider" id="1">
      </div>-->

      <h3>Co-op Industry Visualization Donut Graph</h3>
      <p>The Co-op Industry donut graph is an interactive article I made in which users touch sections of a "donut" graph to see what percentage of our students get a co-op position in that industry.</p>
      <p>This article uses JavaScript and D3.js (a JavaScript visualization library) to create the animations that occur when a user interacts with the graph. If the user chooses an industry that is related to another app story, the article will display a link to that story at the bottom of the page (shown at the end of the .gif below).</p>

        <div class="gfyitem" data-title=true data-autoplay=true data-controls=false data-expand=true data-id="InformalQuaintCleanerwrasse" ></div>
      </div>
      <!--</div>
        <div class="swipeSlider" id="1">
      </div>-->


      <h2>App Store Logistics</h2>
      <p>In addition to creating interactive content, I managed the app submission
        and distribution processes through the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store.</p>
      <p>This process involved creating and managing the licenses and certificates needed to publish that app, as well as managing the app assets and app store submission requirements.</p>

      <h1>Summary</h1>
      <p>This project helped further my understanding of how students in my major play a role in the media industry.</p>
      <p>To overcome the challenges of this project I had to learn how to use new technologies and software, brainstorm content and user relationships, and work through difficulties to establish efficient project workflows.</p>

      <h1>Updates</h1>
      <p>This project continued after my co-op ended, and I am currently working
        on finishing it with a group of students, called "Connect", in the School of Media Sciences at RIT.</p>
      <p>Updates regarding the current state of the app will be posted below.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="italic">January 14, 2016</span> - App update available on
        the Apple App Store and Google Play Store with new icon and iOS splash screens</li>
