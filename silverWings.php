        <p>I am currently the Silver Wings National Public Affairs Officer; the other National Staff members and I were elected in April 2015.</p>

        <p>Silver Wings is a national co-ed professional organization. It is made up of civilians dedicated to developing our members personally and professionally, volunteering in our communities, and educating others about national defense.</p>

            <p>Silver Wings is associated with the U.S. Air Force and several other military organizations. Some of our members are Air Force Reserve Officers' Training Corps (AFROTC) cadets acting in a civilian capacity; however, I am not a cadet (just an interested civilian).</p>

            <p>My time in Silver Wings has taught me the importance of communication and the difficulties that come with undertaking new projects and initiatives, particularly across long distances.</p>

1. small script to center text vertically based on their css percentage heights on homepage
2. move nav over and get mobile version working
