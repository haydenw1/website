          <h1>Cooperative Education</h1>
          <p>Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) requires students in some majors to participate in
            cooperative education (full-time employment in a position related to your college major) before
            they can graduate. Students must apply for a position and be hired, just like a normal job.</p>

          <h2>Requirements</h2>
          <p>My major (Media Arts and Technology) requires me to participate in two ten week terms of co-op before I graduate.</p>

          <h1>My First Co&#8209;op</h1>

          <p>Over the summer of 2015 I was hired by the School of Media Sciences at RIT to develop and
            produce an interactive app with Adobeâ€™s new Digital Publishing Solution software.</p>
