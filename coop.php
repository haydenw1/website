        <p>
          Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) requires students in some majors to participate in
          cooperative education (full-time employment in a position related to your college major) before
          they can graduate. Students must apply for a position and be hired, just like a normal job.
        </p>

        <p>
          My major (Media Arts and Technology) requires me to have two ten week terms of co-op before I graduate.
        </p>

        <h2>Co-op #1</h2>
        <p>
          Over the summer of 2015 I was hired by the School of Media Sciences at RIT, to develop and
          produce an interactive app with Adobeâ€™s new Digital Publishing Solution software.
        </p>

        <h2>Hire me for my second co-op!</h2>
        <p>I am looking for a co-op position for summer 2016; please send me an email if you are interested in learning more about what I can do for your company!</p>

2. move nav over and get mobile version working
3. rough projects format (picture, title, date....at least)
