          <h1 class="masthead">About</h1>

          <h2 class="masthead sub1">Education</h2>

          <p>I am currently a 4th year student at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) in the <span class="bold">Media Arts and Technology progam (Bachelor of Science)</span>.</p>

          <p>The Media Arts and Technology major at RIT is focused on teaching students how to work with print, design, and other digital forms of media.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Digital Technologies - Web design and development, database management, cross media techniques and platforms, and more.</li>
            <li>Design - Typography, page design, traditonal and digital magazine layout, and photo editing and retouching.</li>
            <li>Print - Traditional and digital printing techniques and equipment, as well as print management and workflows.</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="emphasis">My experiences and preferences have pushed me towards the technical elements offered by this major; specifically web development, user interaction and interface design, dynamic email solutions, and database usage and management.</p>

          <p>Throughout all my work I try to provide users or viewers with a consistent interaction and design scheme, accompanied by great page layout and typography.</p>


          <h2 class="masthead sub1">Activities</h2>

          <h3 class="masthead sub2">Silver Wings</h3>

          <p>Silver Wings is a national co-ed professional organization. It is made up of civilians dedicated to developing our members personally and professionally, volunteering in our communities, and educating others about national defense.</p>

          <p>Silver Wings is associated with the U.S. Air Force and several other military organizations. Some of our members are Air Force Reserve Officers' Training Corps (AFROTC) cadets acting in a civilian capacity; however, I am not a cadet (just an interested civilian).</p>

          <p>My time in Silver Wings has taught me the importance of communication and the difficulties that come with undertaking new projects and initiatives, particularly across long distances. While in Silver Wings I have also been given opportunities to speak to groups ranging from 20 to 200 people.</p>

          <p>National Public Affairs Officer</p>

          <p>Chapter Public Affair Officer</p>


          <h3 class="masthead sub2">RIT Club Rugby</h3>

          <p>I started club Rugby at RIT in the spring of 2015. I had never played or watched the game before, but I decided that I should try something new; now I love the challenge of learning and competing in this sport. I play flanker!</p>

          <h2 class="masthead sub1">Hobbies</h2>

          <h3 class="masthead sub2">Programming</h3>

          <p>Most of my programming practice and knowledge is with JavaScript, but I am interested in and have briefly practiced other languages. I am always interested in making something new with code; I have a notebook where I keep my ideas that I slowly work on when I have time.</p>

          <h3 class="masthead sub2">Weightlifting/Exercise</h3>

          <p>I try to stay active and fit, and weightlifting is one of my hobbies, but I currently get most of my exercise from rugby and it keeps me pretty sore. Working out is a great way for me to escape, refocus, and take a break from technology.</p>

          <h3 class="masthead sub2">Netflix</h3>

          <p>I love good T.V. shows and characters, and I will usually have Netflix on if I am working on one of my own projects.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Last Watched: </li>
            <li>Currently Watching: Blacklist</li>
            <li>Next to Watch: </li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="masthead sub2">Books</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>Last Read: The Book of Javascript, 2nd Edition (75%) and Orcs (100%)</li>
            <li>Currently Reading: JavaScript, The Definitive Guide (slowly) and Augustus, First Emperor of Rome</li>
            <li>Next to Read: The Information (5%)</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="masthead sub1">My Home</h3>

          <p>I grew up in a small rural town called Lodi, located in upstate New York. It is a beautiful area in the middle of the finger lakes, and my family has a house near Seneca Lake. I still love going back home when I can to see my family and our dog.</p>
