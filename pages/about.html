<p class="heading">Me</p>

<p class="text">I am currently a 4th year student at the Rochester Institute of Technology. My freshman year I was enrolled in the New Media Interactive Development (BS), before switching to my current major, <span class="bold">Media Arts and Technology (BS)</span>.</p>

<p class="text">The Media Arts and Technology major is focused on giving students exposure to print, design, and other digital forms of media.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Print - through classes on traditional and digital printing techniques and equipment, as well as print management and workflows</li>
  <li>Design - through classes on typography, page design, traditonal and digital magazine layout, and photo editing and retouching.</li>
  <li>Digital Technologies - through classes on web design and development, database management, cross media techniques and platforms, and more.</li>
</ul>

<p class="text">My experiences and preferences have pushed me towards the technical aspects offered in this major; specifically web development, user interaction and interface design, dynamic email solutions, and database usage and management. In addition to these interests I enjoy good page layout and typography.</p>

<p class="activity">Silver Wings</p>

<p class="overview">Silver Wings is a national co-ed professional organization. It is made up of civilians dedicated to developing our members personally and professionally,volunteering in our communities, and educating others about national defense.</p>

<p class="overview">Silver Wings is associated with the U.S. Air Force and several military organizations. Some of our members are Air Force Reserve Officers' Training Corps (AFROTC) cadets acting in a civilian capacity; however, I am not a cadet (just an interested civilian who happened to have an AFROTC cadet as a roomate).</p>

<p class="overview">My involvement in Silver Wings has granted me numerous opportunities to learn and grow as an individual. It has taught me the importance of communication and the difficulties that come with undertaking new projects and initiatives, particularly the difficulties that arise when dealing with long distance communication.</p>

<p class="overview"> My positions in Silver Wings have allowed my to grow professionally through public speaking opportunities with groups in the range of 20 to 200 people. Additionally, I have had plenty of  practice writing and responding to professional correspondence.</p>
