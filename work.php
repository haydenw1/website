          <p>These positions were held in a family winery and brewery business. When I started working I was only in the vineyard doing simple manual labor, like pulling weeds, tucking and trimming vines, moving wires, and picking rocks. When I got older I moved on to machinery work and repair.</p>

          <p>In addition to the vineyard I would work in a retail and production environment in the winery or brewery for events. In these position I would help bottle and package beer and wine, stock merchanise, serve beverages, and provide customer service.</p>

          <p class="bold italic">These jobs taught me the value of hard work, the basics of customer service, and the importance of accepting more responsibilities in the work environment.</p>
