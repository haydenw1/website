        <p>
          I am currently a 4th year student at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT)
          in the Media Arts and Technology program (Bachelor of Science).
        </p>



        <p>
          The Media Arts and Technology (MAAT) program at RIT is focused
          on teaching students aspects of design and layout,
          web development and interactive media, and management in the media industry.
        </p>

        <p>
          During my time as a student in the MAAT program I have been specifically interested in user interaction development and interface design, as well as
          business and project management.</p>

<!--
to do next

1. small script to center text vertically based on their css percentage heights on homepage
2. move nav over and get mobile version working
3. rough projects format (picture, title, date....at least)
